<h3> <strong> What to feed your horse: </strong> </h3>
<ul>
  <li> You should feed your horse good hay thats fresh and clean. </li>
  <li> You should let your horse out into fields so it can eat some grass but not alot because they can get too big. </li>
  <li> No matter what you feed your horse you should never feed it too much. </li>
  <h3> <strong> How to take good care of your horse: </strong> </h3>
  <li>It is always important to look after your horse so they stay young and heathly like any human.</li>
  <li>Always make sure if your horse does go out in the field it is wearing a fly coat so the flys dont hurt its skin.</li>
  <li>Brush the horses fur often because it can collect lumps and bumbs from flies that could only be found by brushing the fur.</li>
  <li>Make sure you are riding with the right bit so</strong>
    
    <p> Get the horse mesured so you know what size saddle you need. make sure you wear protective wear incase fall off.</p>
